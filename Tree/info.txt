                         Tree Data Structure
- Node
- root
- leaf = node with degree 0
- child
- parent
- subtree
- descendent
- ancestors
- degree = no of child
- internal = all nodes except leaf

                        Application of Tree
---- to represent hierarichal Data
    - organization Structure
    - folder Structure
    - xml/html Structure
    - in OOPS(inheritance)
---- Binary Search Tree
---- Binary heap
---- B and B+ tree in DBMS
---- Spanning and shortest path tree in computer network
---- Parse Tree, Expression in compiler


                            Binary Tree
Binary Tree has at most two children
