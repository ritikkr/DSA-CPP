sort function uses by default quick sort and if quick sort is taking more time(more than O(nlogn))
and if doing unfair partitioning , it switches to heap sort and when your array size 
becomes small it switches to insertion sort

Worst case and average case : O(nlogn)

uses introSort(hybrid of quicksort, heapsort and insertion sort
                           
                        Stability in Sorting Algorithm
arr[] = {("Anil", 50), ("Ayan", 80), ("Piyush", 50), ("Rakesh", 80)}
increasing order of marks, if marks is same then alphabetically

Stability in Sorting algorithm means if two item have same value then they appear in same order as it was in original array
