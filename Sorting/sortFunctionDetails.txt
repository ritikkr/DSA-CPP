sort function uses by default quick sort and if quick sort is taking more time(more than O(nlogn))
and if doing unfair partitioning , it switches to heap sort and when your array size 
becomes small it switches to insertion sort
Worst case and average case : O(nlogn)
uses introSort(hybrid of quicksort, heapsort and insertion sort)
